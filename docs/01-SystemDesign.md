# Developer-Ready OurLibrary Access & Control Platform Design Document

* **MySQL** is positioned as both the *analytics/data warehouse* (Doc 1) **and** the *system of record/source of truth* (Doc 3).
* **SQLite** retains Doc 1‚Äôs role (local `TierCode` + `AccessMode` enforcement for the app) while also borrowing Doc 3‚Äôs snapshot discipline (no secrets, metadata only).
* **Quotas**: the **coupon system** (Docs 1&2) is kept as primary, but I note where Doc 3‚Äôs ‚Äúbroker vs static manifest‚Äù could evolve the design later.
* **Access Control**: enforced **client-side with SQLite fields + Drive ACLs** (Doc 1‚Äôs choice), with server-side quota enforcement via Apps Script. Doc 3‚Äôs broker/encryption is noted as optional future expansion.

Here‚Äôs the consolidated artifact:

# OurLibrary ‚Äî Consolidated System Design (v2.5 Draft)

**Standard:** AIDEV-PascalCase-2.5
**Audience:** Developers (backend, client, operations)
**Scope:** Unified design based on Docs 1‚Äì3 with conflict resolution (priority: Doc 1 ‚Üí Doc 2 ‚Üí Doc 3).

---

## 1) Purpose & Philosophy

* **Mission:** Deliver education content affordably and securely.

* **Guiding principles:**
  
  * Keep infra light (serverless where possible).
  * Strong separation of concerns.
  * Multiple layers of enforcement (SQLite UI, Apps Script quotas, Drive ACLs).
  * Auditability and analytics for growth.

---

## 2) System Architecture

* **Client:** Electron desktop app with local SQLite snapshot.
* **Control Plane:** Google Apps Script (REST API + Sheets backend).
* **Content Store:** Google Drive (two sibling folders, Free vs Premium).
* **Analytics / Source of Truth:** MySQL database (central catalog, user/device state, usage metrics).

### High-level Flow

1. App loads SQLite snapshot (Books, Categories, Subjects).
2. User actions (preview/download) ‚Üí validated against `TierCode` + `AccessMode`.
3. Downloads consume coupons via Apps Script API.
4. All events posted to Google Sheets, ingested into MySQL for analytics.
5. Daily publisher builds new SQLite snapshot from MySQL ‚Üí distributed to clients.

---

## 3) Data Model

### SQLite (Client Snapshot)

* **Books(ID, Filename, Title, Author?, Category\_ID, Subject\_ID, GoogleDriveID, TierCode, AccessMode, ‚Ä¶legacy text fields)**
* **Categories, Subjects, DatabaseMetadata**
* Contains **TierCode + AccessMode** so app can enforce UI access rules locally.
* Snapshot signed/daily refreshed. No secrets beyond Drive IDs.

### MySQL (Source of Truth + Analytics)

* **Catalog**: Mirrors SQLite `Books` (+ categories/subjects).
* **Users, Devices, UserDevices**: Account/device mapping.
* **DeviceBookState, DownloadHistory, Events**: Current + audit trail.
* **Staging**: DeviceEvents (from Sheets).
* Acts as authoritative catalog + analytics warehouse.

### Google Sheets (Control Plane)

* **DeviceEvents\_YYYY\_MM**: append-only event log.
* **CouponBalances**: current state per user.
* **CouponLedger**: auditable quota transactions.
* **Roster**: user tier + entitlements.

---

## 4) Access Control

* **TierCode enforcement** (F, P, T): applied in client UI via SQLite + confirmed at server (coupon check).

* **AccessMode enforcement** (D vs V):
  
  * Downloadable ‚Üí coupon required (Free tier).
  * View-only ‚Üí Drive ‚Äúdisable download/print/copy.‚Äù

* **MySQL** + **Sheets** provide authoritative entitlements.

* Future: optional Broker or Encrypted Assets path for stricter enforcement.

---

## 5) Quota & Coupon System

### Daily Replenishment (Apps Script, 00:00 UTC)

* Free users: +2 coupons.
* Premium: effectively unlimited (set high number, e.g. 9999).
* Trial: configurable (Premium-like but time-boxed).

### Consumption

* App requests `consume` API before download.
* Apps Script decrements coupon, logs to ledger.
* Failure (insufficient coupons) ‚Üí graceful denial.

### Audit

* All coupon transactions journaled.
* Ingestion ‚Üí MySQL for quota analytics, conversion funnels, and abuse detection.

---

## 6) File Organization & Drive Integration

* **Folders**: `OurLibrary_Free`, `OurLibrary_Premium`.
* Placement driven by `TierCode`.
* Drive ACLs enforce view-only vs download.
* Daily Drive audit script reconciles file placement & permissions.

---

## 7) Security Model

* **HMAC-SHA256** on all client API calls (rotating keys).
* **EventUID** ensures idempotency.
* **SQLite signatures**: publisher signs manifest daily; app verifies on load.
* **Drive ACLs**: final enforcement of view-only vs downloadable content.

---

## 8) Event & Analytics Pipeline

* App posts events ‚Üí Apps Script ‚Üí Sheets.

* Cron ingestor syncs to MySQL (append DownloadHistory, update DeviceBookState).

* MySQL used for dashboards:
  
  * Downloads by tier/user/time.
  * Reading engagement.
  * Quota usage & conversion opportunities.

* Publisher builds next day‚Äôs SQLite snapshot from MySQL.

---

## 9) Client Application Flow

1. **Login:** get current coupon balance, load SQLite snapshot.

2. **Preview:** always allowed if tier matches; log READ\_PREVIEW.

3. **Download:**
   
   * Validate tier + `AccessMode='D'`.
   * Request coupon consumption.
   * If approved, allow Drive download; log event.

4. **Sync (Premium):** MySQL recommends jobs for multi-device sync.

---

## 10) Ops & Automation

* **Daily Snapshot Publisher:** MySQL ‚Üí SQLite build + sign ‚Üí distribute.
* **Nightly Coupon Reset:** replenish balances.
* **Sheets Ingestor (cron):** pull NEW events, upsert MySQL.
* **Drive Sync Audit:** verify file placement + permissions.
* **Policy Lint Reports:** book counts, mismatches, sync errors.

---

## 11) Evolution Paths

* Start with **coupon system + Drive ACLs** (Doc 1/2).
* Later add Doc 3‚Äôs **broker strict quotas** or **encrypted assets + manifest** for more sophisticated quota enforcement.
* Maintain compatibility: schema supports both approaches.

---

## 12) Developer Notes

* Favor **PascalCase** for schema, classes, and files.
* All scripts require Himalaya headers (AIDEV-PascalCase-2.5).
* Tests must cover: free vs premium entitlements, coupon exhaustion, Drive ACL mismatches, multi-device sync.
* Instrument events for observability and analytics readiness.

---

‚úÖ This merged spec preserves the **coupon-driven access control** (Docs 1 & 2) as the baseline while leaving hooks for Doc 3‚Äôs stricter models. MySQL is the **source of truth** *and* the analytics warehouse, SQLite is the **client snapshot + UI enforcement tool**, and Google Apps Script/Sheets handle **quotas and event collection**.

---

Executive Summary ‚Äî OurLibrary Access & Control Platform

OurLibrary is a next-generation, serverless content distribution system built to make educational resources widely available while preserving publisher control and enabling sustainable growth. It combines the best of Google‚Äôs free ecosystem with a robust local client and analytics-grade backend.

üöÄ Key Features

1. Multi-Layered Access Control

Tiered entitlements (Free, Premium, Trial) enforced at three layers:

Local app (SQLite snapshot: TierCode + AccessMode)

Serverless quota engine (Google Apps Script + Sheets)

Google Drive ACLs (downloadable vs view-only)

Ensures fair access for Free users while preserving value for Premium subscribers.

2. Coupon-Based Quota System

Daily replenishment: Free users get 2 coupons; Premium users unlimited.

Consumption API: Coupons are decremented before each download.

Audit trail: Every transaction logged in Google Sheets & mirrored to MySQL.

Balances user freedom with transparent, measurable controls.

3. Secure, Auditable Distribution

Google Drive as the universal content store:

Two top-level sibling folders: Free & Premium.

View-only enforced with Drive‚Äôs disable download/print/copy.

Daily snapshot publishing: MySQL ‚Üí signed SQLite ‚Üí distributed to apps.

Event logging: Every download, preview, and sync action captured and auditable.

4. Developer-Friendly Data Architecture

SQLite (Client): Lightweight catalog snapshot, simple to distribute, zero secrets.

MySQL (Central): Source of truth + analytics warehouse.

Google Sheets (Control Plane): Append-only journal and coupon balances.

Apps Script (Backend): Quota enforcement & API endpoints secured with HMAC.

A clean separation of roles, easy to maintain and scale.

5. Analytics & Growth Insights

MySQL dashboards track:

Downloads by tier, title, and user.

Reading engagement and preview behavior.

Quota pressure (Free users hitting limits ‚Üí upgrade opportunities).

Enables data-driven decisions for content, pricing, and user conversion.

6. Future-Proof & Extensible

Current baseline: coupon system with Drive ACLs (simple, proven, serverless).

Optional next steps (no rewrites needed):

Broker model: strict per-user quotas via signed download URLs.

Encrypted assets + static manifest: scalable good-faith enforcement.

Designed to evolve as usage grows ‚Äî cheap to run, hard to abuse.

üéØ Why This Matters
