# Gemini Restart Plan

This note preserves the shared context for AI-assisted sessions so we can resume progress without re-reading the full history.

## 1. Primary Objective

Deliver the zero-budget, safety-first architecture captured in `docs/01-SystemDesign.md` and orchestrated through the sequencing milestones in `docs/03-SequencingPlan.md`.

## 2. Current Focus

- Stabilize the unified monorepo (`app/`, `core/`, `scripts/`, `services/`).
- Implement the Firebase token service and manifest-driven updater outlined in the charter.
- Replace any legacy Google Apps Script integrations with the new token workflow once Firebase infrastructure is provisioned.

## 3. Key Assets

- **Design & Charter**: `docs/00-ProjectCharter.md`, `docs/01-SystemDesign.md`.
- **Runtime Code**: `app/` (Electron client) and `core/` (bootstrap + token service).
- **Automation**: `scripts/` (release packaging, token lifecycle) and `services/apps-script/` (legacy coupon API).
- **Configuration Templates**: `config/templates/*.example.json` â€“ copy to `config/` and populate locally.

## 4. Immediate Next Step

Complete the token service integration:
1. Provision Firebase project credentials (store them outside git using the templates).
2. Implement `core/tokenService.js` authentication/URL issuance once Cloud Functions are live.
3. Wire `app/main.js` download flow to request signed URLs and verify manifest hashes.

## 5. Restart Prompt

When resuming, remind the assistant with:

"Please review `OurProject/Gemini Restart Plan.txt` for context and continue from the token service integration milestone."

Maintain this plan at the end of each working session to keep momentum and avoid regressions.
